# stack

A starter repository for MongoDB, Node.js, and Vue.js, with a local environment based on Docker.

# Installation

## Running the stack

```sh
$ docker-compose up
```

## Accessing the stack from a browser

The starter stack works with a load balancer that binds to ports 80 and 443. It currently serves the domain http://stack.localhost. In order to reach the frontend through the stack, you need to edit your `hosts` file (usually under `/etc/hosts` in UNIX environments and `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts` in Windows) and add the following line:

```
127.0.0.1 stack.localhost
```

Now if you visit http://stack.localhost, you will be greeted with the frontend starter project.

## Changing the local domain

If you wish to use a domain name other than http://stack.localhost, simply set the environment variable `DOMAIN` to any domain you want.

```sh
$ DOMAIN=another-domain.localhost docker-compose up
```

You then also need to update your `hosts` file accordingly.
